# GTD-Getting-Things-Done
GTD is a minimalistic and efficient task management app designed to help users capture, organize, and execute tasks seamlessly. Built with Swift, allowing for a fluid workflow without clutter.
Planned Features

1. Calendar View & Deadlines
• Soft & Hard Deadlines: Each task can have two deadlines – a “soft” (reminder) and a “hard” (final) date. This will help users prioritize their tasks based on urgency.
• Calendar Tab: A dedicated tab that displays tasks sorted by their upcoming deadlines. Users can quickly see which tasks are due soon and which have no dates assigned.

2. Tags & Filtering
• Tag Management: Tasks will be able to carry multiple tags. Users can assign or remove tags on the task detail screen.
• Tag-Based Filtering: A new “Tags” screen or filter button will let users see all tasks linked to a specific tag. This enables quick context-based organization (e.g., “Errands,” “Work,” “Research,” etc.).

3. Smart Notifications
• Push Reminders: When a deadline is set, the app will schedule a local notification (via UserNotifications) to remind the user. For soft deadlines, the notification could arrive earlier (e.g., one day before), while hard deadlines might trigger on the exact day/time.

4. Search & Sorting
• Quick Search: Users will be able to filter or search tasks by title or details, making it easier to find specific items within long lists.
• Sorting Options: In addition to a “by deadline” sort, the app will provide quick sorts by priority, creation date, or custom criteria.

5. Enhanced Task Detail Screen
• Deadline Pickers: Instead of basic text entry, dedicated date pickers for both soft and hard deadlines.
• Tags Management: The ability to select existing tags or create new ones on the fly.
• Notification Settings: Users can control if/when they want a reminder sent.
